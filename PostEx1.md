# Postcondition Exercises:
## **Question 1**
**(a) The function given below is unable to be verified; determine where in the specifications it is failing, and fix it.**
```Java
//@ requires num > 0;
//@ ensures \result > num;
 public int multiplyByTwo(int num) {
	return num*2;
}
```
**(b) Suppose that the specifications for num were updated so that it only has to be greater than -1.  Determine why this would cause an error, and how you could fix the remaining specifications to verify the function.**

**(c) Suppose the code was updated to the following, and num must be a positive number. Determine the specifications needed to verify the function.**
```Java
 public int multiplyByTwo(int num) {
	return num/2;
}
```
