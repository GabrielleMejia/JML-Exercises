# Postcondition Exercises:
## **Question 1**
**(a) The function given below is unable to be verified; determine where in the specifications it is failing, and fix it.**
```Java
//@ requires num > 0;
//@ ensures \result > num;
 public int multiplyByTwo(int num) {
	return num*2;
}
```
**Answer and Explanation:**
<span style="color:red">The function</span> below takes in an integer number variable num, and will multiply this number by 2 and return it. However, the OpenJML fails to verify the program with the current specifications. To figure out why the program is failing lets determine what we do know. 

Since the number being passed in is a whole number, we know that the returned result will always be greater than the original number passed in when the number is greater than 0. In other words we can ensure the result will always be greater than num, required that num is greater than zero. However, we also need to take into account the return type is an int; therefore, we need to make sure that the number being passed in * 2 does not exceed the range of the type int. 

We can see here that the program fails to verify because we are not specifying the range of num. To fix this problem, we simply need to include how big num can be.

**(b) Suppose that the specifications for num were updated so that it only has to be greater than -1.  Determine why this would cause an error, and how you could fix the remaining specifications to verify the function.**

**(c) Suppose the code was updated to the following, and num must be a positive number. Determine the specifications needed to verify the function.**
```Java
 public int multiplyByTwo(int num) {
	return num/2;
}
```
## **Question 2**
**Given a rectangle of width w and height h, write a function that finds the area of the rectangle and returns it. Determine the specifications needed to verify the function. (Assume width and height are whole numbers)**
